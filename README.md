Reference Letter
▪ Information asymmetries about workers’ skills are prevalent in labor
markets, especially in the market for low-skill and entry-level jobs.
▪ This can have adverse effects on match quality, ultimately affecting
output and employment.
We would like to investigate if reference letters from former employers
improve applicant screening and gender equity using the data analysis.

The effect of a reference letter is significant. The rate of obtaining an interview
increased from 2.4% to 3.94%, representing a percentage increase of 64% ((3.94 -
2.4) / 2.4 * 100%).
Note: Simply stating that the rate of obtaining an interview increased by 1.54%
(from 2.4% to 3.94%) is not sufficient, as the significance of this 1.54% increase
depends on the base value (2.4%), not just the absolute value of the increase.

The effect of a reference letter is much more significant for female
applicants. The percentage increase in the rate of obtaining an interview for
female applicants is 108.0%, compared to 17.4% for male applicants.
